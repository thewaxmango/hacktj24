					<h3>Intro to<br /> our club</h3>
				</header>
				<p>ICT is a cool club geared towards competitive programming.<br />During eighth periods we have lectures, activities, and contests, such as ACSL.<br />
				    Attend to hone your skills (for both beginner and experienced programmers) and meet a community of like-minded people.
					<br/>Do contests such as <a href="https://codeforces.com/group/M4wsRWBHyZ/contests">codeforces</a> and <a href="https://usaco.org">USACO</a>, and get better by looking at the <a href="resources">resources</a> section, which includes eighth period materials.<br/>

					<h3>Learn about<br /> travel competitions</h3>
				</header>
				<p>We have in-house competitions hosted on the grader during eighth periods, which combined with other heuristics, decides who goes to travel competitions.<br/>
				In-houses will hopefully provide good practice and possible rewards (cookies).<br/>
				Travel competitions are a great experience and we try to send as many people <br/>
				as possible. Make sure to check facebook and your email to recieve <br/>
				important information regarding contests.
